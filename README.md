# STB-Rail-Commodity
There are 7 major rail companies in the United States & Canada:

- BNSF
- CSX
- GTC
- KCS
- NS
- SOO
- UP

Commodity data for all carriers is available on the [Surface Transportation Board website](https://www.stb.gov/econdata.nsf/M%20Statistics%20of%20Class%201%20Feight%20RR?OpenPage&Start=1&Count=300&Collapse=10.7). 

Data is available back to 2006, but is in .PDF format until 2013 when it changes to .XLS(X) format. There are four quarterly and one annual reports per year per carrier. I downloaded all 32 reports from 2013 through Q2 2019 for each carrier to play around. They were all somewhat different and I don't know what I'm doing so I wrote a different script for each carrier even though I could have cleaned them all with one script.
